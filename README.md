## About Me
I am currently a student at CSU Chico pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I intend to eventually get a masters in Machine Learning, but that's in the future because grad school is expensive lol. I was born and raised in the bay area and chico is the first place outside of the bay that I have lived. I love the outdoors and working out. 

## interests
I will always be down to talk about:
* Super Smash Bros. Melee
* Wightlifting and Nutrition
* Movies
* Music

## you can always reach me at these
* slack
* email
* phone: 650-863-9129

## weaknesses
* I communicate less when I get stressed out. This is my biggest weakness and I am learning how to coommunicate more when things start to become too much
* I am pretty terrible at checking my email. 

## strengths 
* I am extremely driven and will make sure my work is done by the given deadline 
* I work well with others and would consider myself a team player
